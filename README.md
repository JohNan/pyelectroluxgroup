### Usage
```bash
usage: cli.py [-h] -k API_KEY -t ACCESS_TOKEN -r REFRESH_TOKEN

options:
  -h, --help        show this help message and exit

required arguments:
  -k API_KEY        API key received from Electrolux
  -t ACCESS_TOKEN   Access token received from Electrolux
  -r REFRESH_TOKEN  Refresh token received from Electrolux
```

### Disclaimer
This client is not officially supported by Electrolux Group. It is a community project, and it is not guaranteed to be up-to-date with the latest changes in the API.
